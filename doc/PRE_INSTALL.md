## Mosquitto Broker

During installation, a [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) broker, [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), may be installed at the same time as Domoticz.
This broker requires a dedicated domain or subdomain to work (ex: mqtt.your.domain.tld) : creating this domain prior installation is a prerequisite.
It's an optional setting: during install if you set, for the MQTT domain, the same domain as your main app domain or enter an empty domain, the broker won't be installed.
