### Important

BEWARE! If you did not activate the Mosquitto Broker within this package, please run following command prior to upgrade:
`sudo yunohost app setting __APP__ mqtt_domain -v your.__APP__.domain.tld` with `your.__APP__.domain.tld` being the current domain of the application.

**Failure to do so may break the app.**

If you did activate the Mosquitto broker, you can proceed safely.

### Version 2024.2

This update to 2024.2 brings a few changes in the package:
- Move to packaging V2: This will move the app folder from `/opt/yunohost/__APP__` to `/var/www/__APP__`. This should not cause any trouble to Domoticz, but some plugins may not like it.For example, Zigbee4Domoticz requires to edit config file in `/var/www/__APP__/plugins/Domoticz-Zigbee/Conf/PluginConf-08.json` to set the correct path in it.
- Since 2024.1, Domoticz provides precompiled binaries for each of the version on the project Github. while previously only the last version was available to download. So upgrades from inside the application have been disabled. This will allow a better integration in YunoHost but requires to prevent as much as possible upgrade from inside the app. From now on, a new package version will be published after each Domoticz update.
